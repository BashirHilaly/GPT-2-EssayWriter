# GPT-2-EssayWriter

Essayai uses the [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) medium model created OpenAI. For simple access to the model I used [HuggingFace.](https://huggingface.co) It contains a webscraper made in selenium to gather an infromation corpus for training

## Usage

This repository is meant to be used as any particular text generation with GPT-2. 
The web scraper has two options. For literature it will go [here](https://literatureessaysamples.com/) for training data. For history or any subject that isnt literature will go to [wikipedia.](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
